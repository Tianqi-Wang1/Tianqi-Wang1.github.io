I am currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Graphics, Vision and Imaging at University College London, UK. At the same time, I work as a research assistant in the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University under the supervision of Dr. Jingcai Guo. Previously, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

My research interests focus on open-world setting and distribution-shift problems, such as Continual Learning and Out-of-Distribution Detection.
